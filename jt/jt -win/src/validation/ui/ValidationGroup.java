/**
 * A group which holds validators that run against components. The group is
 * passed an instance of <code>ValidationUI</code> in its constructor. This is
 * typically something that is able to show the user that there is a problem in
 * some way, possibly enabling and disabling a dialog's OK button or similar.
 * <p>
 * There are two main reasons validation groups exist:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Often a change in one component triggers a change in the validity of
 * another component</li>
 * <li>There are several levels of problem, INFO, WARNING and FATAL. The user
 * should see FATAL messages even if the component their currently interacting
 * with is offering a warning</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * A validation group is typically associated with a single panel. For
 * components this library supports out-of-the-box such as
 * <code>JTextField</code>s or <code>JComboBox</code>es, simply call one of the
 * <code>add()</code> methods with your component and validators. For validating
 * your own components or ones this class doesn't have methods for, you
 * implement and add
 * <code><a href="ValidationListener.html">ValidationListener</a></code>s.
 * <p>
 * The contract of how a validation group works is as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>When an appropriate change in a component occurs, its content shall be
 * validated</li>
 * <li>If either a non-fatal problem or no problem is found when validating the
 * component, all other validators in the group may be run as follows</li>
 * <ul>
 * <li>If the validator for the component the user is currently interacting with
 * <i>did not</i> produce a problem, the worst (by the definition of
 * Problem.isWorseThan()) found is passed to the UI as the current problem. This
 * may be the first problem with ProblemKind.FATAL which is encountered, based
 * on the order validators were added to the group.</li>
 * <li>If the validator for the component the user is currently interacting with
 * <i>did</i> produce a problem, then if its <code>kind()</code> is
 * <code>ProblemKind.FATAL</code>, the UI's setProblem() method is called with
 * that problem. If the problem from the component the user is currently
 * interacting with is <code>ProblemKind.INFO</code> or
 * <code>ProblemKind.WARNING</code>, then all other validators in the group are
 * called. If any problem of a greater severity is found, that problem will be
 * passed to the group's UI's setProblem() method; otherwise the problem from
 * the current component is used.</li>
 * <li>If no problem was produced by the component the user is interacting with,
 * and not by any other, then the UI's <code>clearProblem()</code> method is
 * invoked.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </ul>
 * <h4>Validator Ordering</h4>
 * <p>
 * For the methods which take multiple validators or multiple enum constants
 * from the <a href="../builtin/Validators.html"><code>Validators</code></a>
 * class, order is important. Generally it is best to pass validators in order
 * of how specific they are - for example, if you are validating a URL you would
 * likely pass
 * 
 * <pre>
 * group.add(f, Validators.REQUIRE_NON_EMPTY_STRING, Validators.NO_WHITESPACE,
 * 		Validators.URL_MUST_BE_VALID);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * so that the most general check is done first (if the string is empty or not);
 * the most specific test, which will actually try to construct a URL object and
 * report any <code>MalformedURLException</code> should be last.
 * <p/>
 * Validators for custom components can be added to the group by implementing
 * ValidationListener over a listener you attach to the component in question,
 * by calling <code>add(ValidationListener)</code>.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> All methods on this class must be called from the AWT Event
 * Dispatch thread, or assertion errors will be thrown. Manipulating components
 * on other threads is not safe.
 * <p/>
 * Swing documents are type-safe, and can be modified from other threads. In the
 * case that a text component validator receives an event on another thread,
 * validation will be scheduled for later, <i>on</i> the event thread.

	 * <p>
	 * For example, say you have a dialog that lets you create a new Servlet
	 * source file. As the user types the servlet name, web.xml entries are
	 * updated to match, and these are also in fields in the same dialog. Since

	 * while the runnable is running will trigger validation.
	 * <p>
	 * When the last runnable exits, validateAll(null) will be called to run
	 * validation against the entire newly updated UI.

	 * call to updateComponents without triggering multiple calls to
	 * validateAll() on each Runnable's exit.
